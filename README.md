# collatzConjecture
A project for Drawing Collatz Conjecture visualizer

Collatz Conjecture has not been proven yet.
It states that any positive integer you pick will enentually be reduced to 1 following only 2 rules.
- If the number is even divide it by 2
- If it's odd, multiply 3 and add 1

If you repeat these two operation you will reach 1 eventually.<br>
Though it's not been proven right, it also has not been proven wrong. <br>
But mathematicians have tested by brute force every single number upto 2<sup>68</sup> and none of them disproves the conjecture

In this program I tried to generate a visual on what's going on.

Here's a sample photo
